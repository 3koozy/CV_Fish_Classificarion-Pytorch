# CV_Fish_Classificarion-Pytorch
* a small ML/CV model to classify 8 classes of common fish types with 93%+ accuracy.
* Dataset used : https://www.kaggle.com/crowww/a-large-scale-fish-dataset
* The model is based on vgg16 feature exctractor with an updated last linear layer to reflect predictable classes (8).
* This work is made thanks to inspiring lessons made by Udacity's Deep Learning nanodegree program.    
  
Please feel free to suggest updates , fixes and suggestions.
